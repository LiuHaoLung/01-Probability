    "There exist specimen which fall outside of this range, like the lino weight < 150 kg, or > 250 kg tend to be the exception rather than the rule, this out of this range called outliers.\n",

    "The graph of normal distribution is bell shaped, therefore the majority of the data is centered around the mean, thus values further away from the mean are less likely to occur.\n",

    "The normal distribution's variance is <code>Var(X) = σ^2</code>, the <code>σ^2</code> is usually given when we define the normal distribution, if it isn't given, we can deduce it from the expected value, the formula is <code>Var(X) = E(X ^ 2) - (E(X) ^ 2)</code>.\n",

    "The peculiarity of the normal distribution is the ***68,95,99.7 Law***.\n",

    "This law suggests that for any normally distributed event ***68%*** of all outcomes fall within one standard deviation, that means ***68% fall within <code>μ - σ and μ + σ</code>***.\n",

    "***95%*** fall within two standard deviation, that means ***95% fall within <code>μ - 2σ and μ + 2σ</code>***.\n",
