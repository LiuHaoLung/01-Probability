    "It is a small sample size approximation of a Normal Distribution, so when the sample size is not enough sufficient data, we will use Student's T Distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "The curve of Student's T Distribution is alse bell shaped and symmetric, however it has fatter tails to accommodate the occurrence of values far away from the mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "That is because if such a value features in our limited data, it would be representing a bigger part of the total another key different between the Student's T Distribution and Normal Distribtuion is that apart from the mean and variance and we must alse define the degrees of freedom for the distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we have at least 2 degrees of freedom, the <code>E(Y) = Î¼</code>, <code>Var(Y) = (S^2 * k) / (k - 2)</code>, this <code>S^2</code> means the variance of the sample. \n",
    "\n",
    "Overall the Student's T Distribution is frequently used when conducting statistical analysis and it plays a major role when we want to do hypothesis testing with limited data, since we also have a table summarizing the most important values of its CDF(T-table)."
